🩺 Fetal Health Classification

This project analyzes real clinical data from fetal monitoring (CTG exams) to find patterns related to fetal health. Using Power BI, it shows how some signals — like heart rate, fetal movement, and contractions — can help detect babies with possible health risks during pregnancy.

📌 Project Goals

- Analyze 2,126 real CTG exams
- Understand how fetal signals relate to health conditions
- Show insights through clean, interactive visuals
- Support clinical decisions using data

---

🔍 Questions Explored

- How is fetal health distributed in the dataset?
- Do babies with health risks have higher heart rates?
- Can the lack of heart rate accelerations signal danger?
- How do key health signals behave in each risk group?
- Are strong contractions linked to more risky cases?

---

🧠 Summary

The dataset was explored using Power BI, with a focus on clear questions and real-world meaning. The results show that **looking at multiple signals together** helps detect possible risks better than using just one signal.

Simple dashboards and charts make it easier to understand how clinical signs change between healthy babies and those who may need more medical attention.

📊 Power BI Dashboard


Final dashboard created in Power BI. It summarizes key health signals by group and helps spot patterns quickly using filters and visuals.

✅ Conclusion

This project showed how real health data can help detect early signs of risk in babies. It also helped me improve my skills with Power BI, ask the right questions, and explain results in a simple and useful way.
