he **reduction of infant and maternal mortality** is one of the main global goals established by the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. The objective is that, by 2030, all countries reduce the mortality rate of children under 5 years to less than **25 per 1,000 live births**, and eliminate preventable deaths of **newborns and pregnant women**. In 2017 alone, for example, around **295,000 maternal deaths** were recorded â€” most of them in low-resource settings and, in the majority of cases, preventable.

In this context, **fetal health monitoring** through **cardiotocography (CTG)** exams presents itself as an accessible and effective solution. CTG measures the **fetal heart rate**, **baby's movements**, and **uterine contractions**, providing valuable information that helps healthcare professionals identify potential complications early in pregnancy.

This project aims to analyze clinical data extracted from CTGs to develop a **fetal health classification system**. The analysis is based on a dataset containing **2,126 real-world exams**, each reviewed by **three medical experts**, who assigned one of the following classifications: **normal (1)**, **suspicious (2)**, or **pathological (3)**. The dataset was originally made available by the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and later organized for Kaggle by Andrew Mvd.

This material supports **data-driven clinical decision-making**, helping to prevent fetal complications and, as a result, **contributing to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality**.
