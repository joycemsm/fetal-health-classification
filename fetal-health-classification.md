# Fetal Health Classification

The **reduction of infant and maternal mortality** is one of the main global commitments established by the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. The aim is that, by 2030, all countries reduce the mortality rate of children under the age of 5 to less than **25 per 1,000 live births** and eliminate preventable deaths of **newborns and pregnant women**. In 2017, for example, around **295,000 maternal deaths** were recorded—mostly in low-resource regions and, in most cases, avoidable.

In this context, **fetal health monitoring** through **cardiotocography (CTG)** exams offers an accessible and effective solution. CTG evaluates the **fetal heart rate**, the **baby’s movements**, and **uterine contractions**, providing valuable insights that help healthcare professionals identify possible complications early during pregnancy.

This project aims to analyze clinical data obtained from CTGs to develop a **fetal health classification system**. The analysis is based on a dataset with **2,126 real-world exams**, each evaluated by **three medical specialists**, who assigned one of the following classifications: **normal (1)**, **suspicious (2)**, or **pathological (3)**. The dataset was originally published by the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and later organized on Kaggle by Andrew Mvd.

The material supports **data-driven clinical decision-making**, helping to prevent fetal complications and thereby **contributing to the reduction of maternal and infant mortality**.
